Keanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means "cool breeze over the mountains" in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Patric Reeves, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu's mother is originally from Essex England. After his parents' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname "The Wall") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.

After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Οργισμένο αίμα (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, Στην άκρη του ποταμού (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Επικίνδυνες σχέσεις (1988) with director Stephen Frears.

His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted "Theodore" Logan in Οι εξαιρετικές περιπέτειες του Μπιλ και του Τεντ (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard's comedy, Δεσμοί στοργής (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan's Σ' αγαπώ μέχρι θανάτου (1990).

Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix's narcoleptic male hustler in Το δικό μου Αϊντάχο (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in Δράκουλας (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Πολύ κακό για το τίποτα (1993).

In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Speed (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Όλα του γάμου δύσκολα (1996) and Την τελευταία φορά που αυτοκτόνησα (1997), and big films like Περπατώντας στα σύννεφα (1995) and Ο δικηγόρος του διαβόλου (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too: Ο φυγάς του μέλλοντος (1995) and Αλυσιδωτή αντίδραση (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings' cyberadventure, The Matrix (1999).

Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them Οι αντικαταστάτες (2000), Ο παρατηρητής (2000), Το χάρισμα (2000), Γλυκός Νοέμβρης (2001), and Σκληρό καρύδι (2001) - before The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003) were both released in 2003.

Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Κάλλιο αργά παρά αργότερα (2003), Έρωτας δίχως παρόν (2006), and Η εξουσία της νύχτας (2008). He's kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Constantine (2005), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and Όταν η Γη σταματήσει (2008). And he's waded back into art-house territory with Ellie Parker (2005), Thumbsucker (2005), Οι κρυφές ζωές της κυρίας Λι (2009), and Το σχέδιο του Χένρι (2010).

Most recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Ronin (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Side by Side (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, Ο μαχητής του Τάι Τσι (2013).

In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film John Wick (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in John Wick: Κεφάλαιο 2 (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.
