Liam Neeson was born on June 7, 1952 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, to Katherine (Brown), a cook, and Bernard Neeson, a school caretaker. He was raised in a Catholic household. During his early years, Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, a truck driver, an assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary's Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play "The Risen People". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin's Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Eξκάλιμπερ (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role.

Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including Η ανταρσία του Μπάουντι (1984), A Woman of Substance (1984), Η αποστολή (1986), and Ντουέτο για μία (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Οι ύποπτοι (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in Η καλή μητέρα (1988) and Παν-δαιμόνιο (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Υποψίες (1991) and Ήθαν Φρομ (1992), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen's Παντρεμένα ζευγάρια (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Η λίστα του Σίντλερ (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.

Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in "Anna Christie", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Νελ (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Ρομπ Ρόι: Εις το όνομα της τιμής (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Μάικλ Κόλινς, ο επαναστάτης (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood's top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Ο πόλεμος των άστρων: Επεισόδιο 1 - Η αόρατη απειλή (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey - Ας μιλήσουμε για το σεξ (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan's Μπάτμαν: Η αρχή (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in Το χρονικό της Νάρνια: Το λιοντάρι, η μάγισσα και η ντουλάπα (2005).

Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Η αρπαγή (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Η τιτανομαχία (2010) and Ομάδα Α (2010), and returned to the action genre with Ο άγνωστος (2011), The Grey (2011), Ναυμαχία (2012) and Η αρπαγή 2 (2012), as well as the sequel Η οργή των τιτάνων (2012).

Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).
