A whiz-kid with special effects, Robert is from the Spielberg camp of film-making (Steven Spielberg produced many of his films). Usually working with writing partner Bob Gale, Robert's earlier films show he has a talent for zany comedy (Κυνηγώντας το πράσινο διαμάντι (1984), 1941: Από που πάνε για το Χόλιγουντ, παρακαλώ; (1979)) and special effect vehicles (Ποιος παγίδεψε τον Ρότζερ Ράμπιτ (1988) and Επιστροφή στο μέλλον (1985)). His later films have become more serious, with the hugely successful Tom Hanks vehicle Forrest Gump (1994) and the Jodie Foster film Επαφή (1997), both critically acclaimed movies. Again, these films incorporate stunning effects. Robert has proved he can work a serious story around great effects.
