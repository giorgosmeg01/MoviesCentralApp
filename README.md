# MoviesCentralApp
This project is a full-stack web application inspired by IMDb, designed to manage and display information about movies, actors, directors, and user reviews. Users can search for movies, view details, rate films, and manage a personal watchlist. It was built using MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for clean separation of concerns, making it scalable and maintainable.
The app leverages .NET 8.0 for the backend, Entity Framework Core for ORM, and Microsoft SQL Server 2019 as the database. Development was done in Visual Studio Code 2022, emphasizing a lightweight, cross-platform setup.
